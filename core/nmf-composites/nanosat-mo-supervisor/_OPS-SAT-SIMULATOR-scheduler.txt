#Simulator scheduler data file
#The commands below will be executed when simulator time has exceeded the defined time
#There are two possible ways to define the command, either as a DDDDD:HH:MM:SS:mmm format or directly in milliseconds value
#The simulator shall check the agreement between the two fields, if not equal, the DDDDD:HH:MM:SS:mmm will be used
#If the DDDDD:HH:MM:SS:mmm is zero, the milliseconds value will be used
#The simulator shall also sort the data file chronologically ascending
#days:hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds|milliseconds|internalID|argument_template_name
